-   [How to Develop](#section18816105182315)

Regardless of the OS and system on a chip \(SoC\), the sensor driver is developed based on the HDF, platform, and OSAL APIs to provide a unified driver model for sensor devices. This section uses the acceleration sensor as an example to describe how to develop a sensor driver.

## How to Develop<a name="section18816105182315"></a>

1.  Register the acceleration sensor driver. The HDF provides a unified driver management model. The HDF identifies and loads the target module driver based on the configuration information of the acceleration sensor module.
2.  Initialize and deinitialize the acceleration sensor driver. Using the  **init**  function, the HDF starts loading the sensor device driver and allocating configuration resources for sensor device data, respectively. Using the  **release**  function, the HDF releases the resources and configurations loaded by the driver.
3.  Parse the configurations of the acceleration sensor register group. For different types of sensors, you need to configure their respective HCS configuration files in the HCS, check whether the sensor device is in position during the device driver startup, and then load the corresponding configuration file to generate the configuration structure object.
4.  Implement APIs for acceleration sensor driver operations. The driver APIs for various types of sensors, such as  **init**,  **GetInfo**,  **Enable**,  **Disable**,  **SetBatch**,  **SetMode**,  **SetOption**, and  **ReadSensorData**, are normalized to deliver sensor driver configurations and report sensor data.

>The sensor driver model provides a collection of APIs to implement sensor driver capabilities, including the driver device management capabilities, abstract bus and platform operation capabilities, general configuration capabilities, and configuration parsing capabilities. For details about the APIs, see  [Table 2](sensor-driver-overview.md#table1156812588320). You need to implement the following APIs: some operations to perform on sensors \([Table 3](sensor-driver-overview.md#table1083014911336)\), differentiated data configuration of the sensor HCS, and verification of basic driver functions.
